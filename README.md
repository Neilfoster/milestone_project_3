 # Creative Kids
 
 Creative Kids is an app built with Flask And MongoDB.The aim of my project is to
 use the technologies I have learnt so far to create a simple yet effective app which
 allows users to create and view activities for kids.
 
 In this project I have used [Python](https://www.python.org/) along with the Python framework 
 [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html),[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
 (A document based database) and a css framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for
 layout and styling purposes.
 
 ## UX
 I wanted to create a simple but much needed app that could benefit parents when they 
 run out of ideas of how to keep their kids entertained and also to bond with them
 through play. The app is designed to allow users to create, manage and store ideas all 
 in one place. Is has a simple , bright and enegetic design scheme to make the app 
 intuitive and energetic. There is also a filter designed to pick only the age group and duration 
 that the user needs to avoid clutter. 
 
 ## User Stories 
 > As a user I would like to be able to view activities to bond wth my child
 
 > I need an app where I can share my ideas for play activities for children
 and be able to access them later. 
 
 > I would like to see an app where I can filter through activities by age group and
 lenght to avoid spending time searching through everything.
