 # Creative Kids
 
 Creative Kids is an app built with Flask And MongoDB.The aim of my project is to
 use the technologies I have learnt so far to create a simple yet effective app which
 allows users to create and view activities for kids.
 
 In this project I have used [Python](https://www.python.org/) along with the Python framework 
 [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html),[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
 (A document based database) and a css framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for
 layout and styling purposes.
 
 ##UX
 I wanted to create a simple but much needed app that could benifit parents when they 
 run out of ideas of how to keep their kids entertained and also to bond with them
 through play. The app is designed to allow users to create, manage and store ideas all 
 in one place.
